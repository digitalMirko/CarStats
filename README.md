# CarStats
Swift - Car Stats App

App created in Xcode 10.2.1 (10E1001) using Swift 4.2, iOS Deployment Target 12.2 and tested on a iPhone Xr Emulator

They say its a good thing if we learn one new thing everyday, well this demo does just that.

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Car Stats' icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a black background with the vehicle image on top in color already randomly selected as the app is started.
Then right below is the vehicles name in bold. Followed by a series of labels that give various interesting stats like
BHP (Brake Horse Power), 0-60 speed time, Top speed in mph (Miles per hour), MPG (Miles Per Gallon) then price in U.S. Dollars.
Right below that is a button with the title 'Random Car Stats'. Each time the button is clicked another random vehicle 
is chosed.

In this demo the vehicles available are: Aston Martin Vantage, Audi A8, Bentley Continental GT, Ferrari 488, Jaguar XE,
Mercedes Benz AMG GT Roadster, Lamborghini Aventador, McLaren 570GT, Porsche 928 GTS
